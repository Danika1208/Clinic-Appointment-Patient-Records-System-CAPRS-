Clinic Appointment & Patient Records System (CAPRS)

1. Problem Statement : Healthcare providers, clinics, and small hospitals frequently struggle with fragmented and inefficient operational processes. Reliance on paper-based records, disparate scheduling systems, and manual billing processes leads to:

a) Medical Errors and Delays: Slow retrieval of patient history, drug interactions, or critical allergy information.

b) Administrative Inefficiency: Scheduling conflicts, long check-in times, and staff time wasted on repetitive data entry.

c) Poor Patient Experience: Long wait times, difficulty booking appointments, and lack of clarity on bills and follow-ups.

The Clinic Appointment & Patient Records System (CAPRS) will provide a unified, digital platform to streamline administrative tasks, ensure instant access to secure patient data, and improve the overall quality of care delivery.

2. Scope of the Project : The initial scope (Version 1.0) of this project, codenamed "CAPRS," is defined as a secure, web-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Practice Management application.

Inclusions (V1.0 Focus):

a) Core Patient Data Management: Secure storage and retrieval of demographics, history, allergies, and diagnoses.

b) Appointment Management: Scheduling, rescheduling, cancellation, and automated SMS/email reminders.

c) Clinical Access Module: Dedicated interface for doctors to view patient charts, record consultations, and prescribe medication.

User Roles: Separate, strictly-defined access levels for Administrative Staff, Clinicians (Doctors), and System Administrators.

Exclusions (V1.0 Out of Scope):

Integration with advanced diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/CT machines).

Integration with third-party billing and insurance claim clearinghouses.

In-depth laboratory information system (LIS) module beyond basic result entry.

Telemedicine or video consultation capabilities.
